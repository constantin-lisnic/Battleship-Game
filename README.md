# The Battleship Game

## Here's how the game works:

- In order to win the game you have to sink all the battleships.
- Write your guesses in the input located in the bottom-right corner (i.e. C4).
- There are 3 ships in total on the board; and each ship has a length of 3.
- Every time the page is refreshed, the battleships are randomly placed.
- In the top-left corner, you will be notified whether you missed or hit the battleship.
- When all the battleship was hit 3 times, you will be also notified that the battleship is sunk.
- In the end, when all battleships are sunk, you will get a message telling you how many guesses it took you to win the game.
